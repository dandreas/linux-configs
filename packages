Packages to install on a fresh linux system:
emacs (not required, still need to set it up config wise. best to just use vim for now)
git (if not installed. do this before vim.)
vim (with config files)
htop
Atom (web)
    minimap
    atom-material-ui
    atom-material-syntax-dark
    file-icons
Google Chrome (web)
Spotify (self ppa)
i3 (with config files)
<numix ppa>
numix-gtk-theme
numix-icon-theme-circle
</numix ppa>

Note:
If install is a server:
preinstalls:
    (ALWAYS) OpenSSH Server (this will allow you to SSH into the server)
    (if file server) Samba File Server

*END*
NOTE FOR REPLACING/UPGRADING SYSTEMS:
Always back up config files for all of the above programs (when applicable)
ESPECIALLY: i3, emacs, vim
Also, update the package list on Atom if applicable. 
Not doing this will likely bite you in the ass later.
